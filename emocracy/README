citizens. The project is meant to be as open as possible , information should

and websites.

Installation:

I asume basic python , django, linux and scm knowledge.

Installing emocracy for development:

Make sure django installation is the svn django-1.0.x

do an svn checkout and make sure your python site-packages/django 
points to the django-1.0 directory.

$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/ django-1.0

$ cd /use/lib/python2.5/site-packages #this differs on various systems.
$ ln -s /home/user/bla/*path to django-1.0 dir*/django django

check if it is working by doing trying to import django in the python interpreter!

cd to the emorcacy directory. default settings.py uses sqlite3 as database backend and you dont need
to install annything if you are using python >= python2.5

create the database
$ python manage.py syncdb

now run the robots script to fill up the database with fake data.
$ python robots_users.py
$ python robot.py NUMBER , will fill up the database with number of issues.

not you are ready to run your testserver!!

$ python manage.py runserver 8080
