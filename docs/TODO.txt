The Issue model needs a origin entry, that keeps track of where an issue 
originated (which interface created it). This will allow there to be one big 
issue database whilst still allowing users to filter out all 'Eve online' issues
(for example).

Emcracy also needs to be able to 'delete' issues that are inapropriate (from a 
legal perspective).

Move to Django 1.1 to solve the CSRF middleware situation.
