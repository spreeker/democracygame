Democracy project is a government sponsored project which has as main goal
creating a voting game api to enhanche political awareness of citizens
We are developing a Dashboard for your voting data and a mobile interface
for the api. Democracy is meant to be as open as possible, information should
be free and it should be easy to integrate our tools/game into other tools
and websites.

Installation:
=============

I asume basic python , django, linux and scm knowledge.

Installing democracy for development:

requirements: 
-------------

# python2.6 , oauth library needs it.
# markup
# dist-utils
# django-trunk (10-2010)

# gettext

We provided most extra packages in the external external_app directory.
The settings and wsgi example apache configuration takes care of putting that directory
in your python path.

$ python manage.py runserver 8080

Testing
=======

We put quite some effort in creating tests for our application

$ python manage.py test

To only test the api:

$ python manage.py test api 

and to test only the voting app

$ python manage.py test tests --settings=voting.tests.settings
