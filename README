emo:
check www.emocracy.nl or wiki.emocrqacy.nl for project information.

This project is a government sponsored project which has as main goal
creating a voting tool game api to enhanche political awareness of 
citizens. The project is meant to be as open as possible , information should
be free and it should be easy to integrate our tools/game into other tools
and websites.

Installation:

I asume basic python , django, linux and scm knowledge.

Installing emocracy for development:

Make sure django installation is the svn django-1.0.x

do an svn checkout and make sure your python site-packages/django 
points to the django-1.0 directory.

$ svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/branches/releases/1.0.X/ django-1.0

$ cd /use/lib/python2.5/site-packages #this differs on various systems.
$ ln -s /home/user/bla/*path to django-1.0 dir*/django django

check if it is working by doing trying to import django in the python interpreter!

cd to the emorcacy directory. default settings.py uses sqlite3 as database backend and you dont need
to install annything if you are using python >= python2.5

create the database
$ python manage.py syncdb

now run the robots script to fill up the database with fake data.
$ python robots_users.py
$ python robot.py NUMBER , will fill up the database with number of issues.

Finally create a settings_local.py file in which you put you local settings
i think an empty file will work as well. but i must be there otherwise there
will be import errots because settins_local.py gets impored by settings.py
settings_local.py is ignored by git so you can have you password settings ect in there.

not you are ready to run your testserver!!

$ python manage.py runserver 8080
